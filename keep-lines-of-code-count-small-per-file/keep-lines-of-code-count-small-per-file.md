Our development standards mandate that individual code files strive to remain under {{ .LineCountPerFile }} lines, while recognizing that justified outliers may occasionally be warranted.  Keeping the line count per file at or under {{ .LineCountPerFile }} is not a strict limit but rather a goal.

This principle requires the systematic decomposition of extensive logic into multiple discrete files rather than permitting the accumulation of excessive lines within singular documents.

By maintaining this disciplined approach to file organization, we promote sound information hiding practices, ensuring that complex implementation details are appropriately abstracted and encapsulated within focused, comprehensible modules.
