I'm interested in learning about the `go-getter` package by hashicorp.

I've includeded it in the go_getter_source xml element here:

```
<go_getter_source>
{{ snippet "go-getter-subset.txtar" | trim }}"
</go_getter_source>
```

Please create a bash command-line cheatsheet showing the different URL formats and protocols supported by the go-getter package.

Focus on the actual URL syntax users would type in a terminal, not the Go code implementation.

Include examples for all supported protocols like HTTP, Git, S3, etc., and show any special parameters or options in the URLs.
