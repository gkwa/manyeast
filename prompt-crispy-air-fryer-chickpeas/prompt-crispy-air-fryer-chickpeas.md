**Food Innovation Challenge: Air Fryer Chickpeas - Eliminating Post-Cooking Dryness**

We have successfully developed crispy air fryer chickpeas with excellent Indian-inspired flavor using spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala.

Our current process involves air-frying at 400Â°F for 15-20 minutes with minimal oil, which creates the desired crispy texture.

However, the finished product creates an extremely chalky, dry eating experience that leaves consumers desperately needing water - similar to eating white bread in the desert while dehydrated.

The challenge is specifically about post-cooking dryness and mouthfeel, not the intentional pre-cooking moisture removal process.

We need solutions that address the chalky, cotton-mouth sensation experienced during consumption while preserving the crispy texture achieved through proper pre-drying.

The ideal solution must maintain our current health profile with minimal oil usage.

Robust Indian-inspired flavor profiles must be preserved throughout any moisture management solution.

The crispy, satisfying crunch texture that results from proper pre-drying and air-frying cannot be compromised.

Research focus should be on post-cooking applications such as light misting, surface treatments, or coatings that improve mouthfeel without sacrificing crispiness.

We are seeking natural ingredients or techniques that stimulate saliva production or provide subtle moisture during eating.

Solutions should distinguish between beneficial pre-cooking dryness (which creates crispiness) and problematic post-cooking dryness (which creates poor mouthfeel).

Success will be measured by decreasing the chalky sensation and cotton-mouth effect while maintaining all current positive attributes of flavor, texture, and health profile.
