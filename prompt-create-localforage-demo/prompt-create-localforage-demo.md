I'm interested in learing about the localforage npm package for storing state

Will you create CRUD application that makes heavy use of this package as a demo 
of its capabilites?

The project name will be {{ .ProjectName }}

{{ include "../pnpm-project/pnpm-project.md" . | trim }}"

{{ include "../use-vite/use-vite.md" . | trim }}"
