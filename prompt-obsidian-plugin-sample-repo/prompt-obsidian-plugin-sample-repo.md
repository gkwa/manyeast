I would like to build an obsidian plugin and for this obsidian recommends I download the sample repo as template starter from here:
https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin.git.

I see documentation for how to get starteed here:
https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin

I've included it here.

```
<obsidian_sample>
{{ snippet "sample.txtar" | trim }}"
</obsidian_sample>
```

Please write readme that describes each file here and the workflow involved with it.

{{ snippet "../add-google-search-links/add-links.md" | trim }}"

For each file, add search links that describe its purpose and flow.
