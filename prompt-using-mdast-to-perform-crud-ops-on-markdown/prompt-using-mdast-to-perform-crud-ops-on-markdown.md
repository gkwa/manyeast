Lets try using [mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast) package to perform CRUD operations on a markdown file.

MDAST supports Github flavored markdown (GFM), so let's make our tests using that.

Please make sure to create tests.

We will use typescript.

{{ include "../use-vite/use-vite.md" . | trim }}"

{{ include "../pnpm-project/pnpm-project.md" . | trim }}"
