vsode has a wonderful fuzzy finder for finding files based off paths

vscode also runs on in the browser so I assume all of the vscode components are available as packages that can be reused in other projects.

How then for example would we reuse vscode fuzzy finder in a new web app

Without writing code, first lets discuss the options.
