When I click a link in google chrome, then chrome fetchtes and presents this page to me.

I'm interested in creating some method either through chrome extension or golang proxy or lambda function or any other means to adjust the flow like this:

when I click a link in google chrome, I want the url sent along with the page that the url is in sent as a dictionary to an endpoint like sms queue or some other endpoint.

I don't want to code now, instead I want to discuss options and possibly change my flow given what ideas we can generate.  Perhaps discussing this will reveal that what I'm trying to do can be done easier another way.
