## Directions

1. Cook onion and garlic: 
   
   Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high. Add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook, stirring often, until garlic is lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes.

2. Cook kale: Add kale; cook, stirring occasionally, until kale starts to wilt, about 2 minutes.

3. Add broth: Stir in vegetable broth. Bring to a simmer over medium-high; reduce heat to low.

4. Simmer soup: Cover and simmer, undisturbed, until kale is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.

5. Add bread: Stir in bread, lemon juice, and salt.

6. Blend soup: Working in 2 batches, ladle mixture into a blender. Secure lid on blender, and remove center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening. Process until smooth, about 1 minute per batch. Transfer pureed soup to pot, and bring to a simmer over medium-low.

7. Add half-and-half and cheese: Stir in half-and-half and Parmesan. Season with additional salt to taste.

8. Garnish and serve: Garnish with Kale Chips, and serve.
