I need to perform CRUD operations on a markdown file using any language that has good support for this.

Ideally we'd have abstract syntax tree access to the markdown graph and be able to maniuploate nodes and then finally write the markdown back to file and compare to what we expect.

So for this we'll need proper testing.

Which language or package offers the best support.
