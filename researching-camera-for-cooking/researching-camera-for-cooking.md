I would like to take video notes on cooking but I find it too tedious to talk into my phone's audio recording app and too tedious to write notes down.

The camera must be able to record audio and video.

I have no experience using these and there are many things to consider such as:

- head mounting strap if the camera is of the type you could strap to your forehead

- how long camera can record before having to be recharged
