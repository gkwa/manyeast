Scale my recipe ingredients proportionally based on the new amount I specify.

Show all scaling calculations using LaTeX math notation.

Convert measurements to larger units when appropriate (e.g., teaspoons to tablespoons, tablespoons to cups, cups to quarts).

Never use fractional teaspoons or tablespoons - always round to whole numbers and indicate when you've rounded.

Preserve the original markdown formatting, including checkboxes, links, and any special annotations.

Display both the mathematical work and the final scaled recipe with converted units.
