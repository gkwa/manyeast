I visited various retailers and searched for frozen salmon and got these results:

```
<frozen_samlmon_results>
{{ include "data-frozen-salmon.json" . | trim }}
</frozen_samlmon_results>
```

Only some of them are what I'm interested in.

I need to employ NLP techniques to 

- filter to only the products that I'm interested in based off my particular interests
- detect price for the product

{{ include "categories.md" . | trim }}

I want to use NLP techniques to help find what I'm looking for in these results but I don't know how to get started.
