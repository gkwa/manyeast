This system categorizes "desired products" to enhance search results, though these categories should be viewed skeptically.

When a user visits a retailer's website (e.g., https://safeway.com) and searches for a category like "olive oil," the system returns the best match for the requested product.

It also provides additional recommended products that complement or relate to the original search query.

The process leverages search intent to suggest relevant alternatives and complementary items, expanding beyond the initial product request.

However, these recommendations represent the seller's attempt to influence purchasing decisions rather than genuinely serve customer interestsâ€”the suggested products may prioritize profit margins, inventory clearance, or promotional partnerships over actual customer needs or preferences.
