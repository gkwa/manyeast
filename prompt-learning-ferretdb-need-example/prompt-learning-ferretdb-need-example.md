I'm curious about the FerretDB API in go.

I've included a documentation snippet in doc_snippet xml element below.


https://docs.ferretdb.io/guides/vector-search/


```
<doc_snippet>
{{ snippet "/tmp/prompt-learning-ferretdb-need-example/docs.txt" | trim }}"
</doc_snippet>
```




reminders for how to include templates

// include and interpret
{{ include "../add-google-search-links/add-links.md" . | trim }}"
