sourdough starter requires feeding at some regular schedule

suppose I properly feed my starter for 1month

then I check the quality of my starter at this time

next I continue feeding my starter properly for the next 2 years

is the quality of the starter better than at the first month?

IOW, does the quality of start improve over time?
