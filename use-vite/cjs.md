which states

CJS
Vite CJS Node API deprecated
The CJS build of Vite's Node API is deprecated and will be removed in Vite 6. See the GitHub discussion for more context. You should update your files or frameworks to import the ESM build of Vite instead.

In a basic Vite project, make sure:

The vite.config.js file content is using the ESM syntax.
The closest package.json file has "type": "module", or use the .mjs/.mts extension, e.g. vite.config.mjs or vite.config.mts.
For other projects, there are a few general approaches:

Configure ESM as default, opt-in to CJS if needed: Add "type": "module" in the project package.json. All *.js files are now interpreted as ESM and need to use the ESM syntax. You can rename a file with the .cjs extension to keep using CJS instead.
Keep CJS as default, opt-in to ESM if needed: If the project package.json does not have "type": "module", all *.js files are interpreted as CJS. You can rename a file with the .mjs extension to use ESM instead.
Dynamically import Vite: If you need to keep using CJS, you can dynamically import Vite using import('vite') instead. This requires your code to be written in an async context, but should still be manageable as Vite's API is mostly asynchronous.
If you're unsure where the warning is coming from, you can run your script with the VITE_CJS_TRACE=true flag to log the stack trace:


VITE_CJS_TRACE=true vite dev
If you'd like to temporarily ignore the warning, you can run your script with the VITE_CJS_IGNORE_WARNING=true flag:


VITE_CJS_IGNORE_WARNING=true vite dev
Note that postcss config files do not support ESM + TypeScript (.mts or .ts in "type": "module") yet. If you have postcss configs with .ts and added "type": "module" to package.json, you'll also need to rename the postcss config to use .cts.
