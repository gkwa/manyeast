I prefer the return early pattern with guard clauses over nested if/else statements when writing code. Guard clauses check preconditions upfront and exit early when requirements aren't met, creating linear code flow that's easier to follow.

There are situations where traditional if/else structures are more appropriate and make the code clearer, especially for simple binary decisions or when the logic genuinely represents two equal paths rather than error handling followed by business logic.

Sometimes trying to force the return early pattern doesn't make sense and actually creates more clutter, particularly in short functions where a single if/else is more readable than multiple guard clauses, or when the conditions don't represent failure cases but legitimate alternative behaviors.

Will you update our codebase to use return early with guard clauses in places where it reduces complexity and improves readability? Focus on functions where you can identify clear precondition checks (null references, invalid parameters, boundary conditions) that can be handled as guards, followed by the main business logic as the "happy path."

Only apply this pattern where it genuinely makes the code cleaner and more maintainable, not everywhere possible. Look for opportunities to flatten nested conditions, eliminate arrow anti-patterns, and separate error handling from core functionality - but preserve simple if/else structures where they're already clear and concise.
